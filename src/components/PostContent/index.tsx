              Launched in early November 2023, the sportswear company offers
              alternative, darker sports pieces for the fashion-forward fitness
              fanatic that until now have been hard to find. Each garment is
              designed in moody tones with oversized silhouettes and structured
              tailoring. VEYND approached By Association Only to mirror this
              darker aesthetic online. We also maximised the brandâ€™s opportunity
              to story-tell through full-page immersive campaign films and
              images.
